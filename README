TODO for Paul and Casey before they leave for summer 2014

Model building:
- put all model-building everything into a directory (model_building) (you can give this a shorter name if you'd like - models?)
- write a script (model_building/build.py) that builds the model (with the current best options set) from all the current data
- put comments in the top of that script that explains the steps it's going to take and what it's doing.  maybe even have it print out its progress along the way!

Rec system:
- put all rec system everything into a direcotry (recommendations) (you can give this a shorter name if you'd like - recs?)
- write a script (recommendations/build.py) that builds the rec system (with the current best options set) and pushes the recs out to the website
- put comments in the top of that script that explains the steps it's going to take and what it's doing.  maybe even have it print out its progress along the way!

Cleaning research:
- after these directories exist, some stuff should be gone from research
- move the stuff that isn't gone from research into research subdirectories (i.e., recommendations/research and model_building/research)

Cleaning the base directory:
- replace this README with an actual readme that says what's here
