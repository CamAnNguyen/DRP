'''This file contains tests which validate the html output and will eventually
also contain unit tests for javascript components, and tests for correct (rather than
simply valid) markup.

These tests should NOT be utilised for testing django functionality of webpages, which
should be managed by other unit tests on views (worst case) or their components
(preferred).
